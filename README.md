# Meet Omni: Your Cosmic Kit to OmniNode

> *"Welcome to OmniNode! I made this place so you can talk to people from my planet and do cool stuff."* > **— Omni, Chief Agent Handler**

![omni](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9bb3a17-0e03-42a7-818d-6384c541c267)

Meet Omni. He might look a little *bhondu* (innocent, slightly clueless, and undeniably cute), but don't let the oversized utility vest and the wide, curious eyes fool you. Omni is a multi-dimensional prodigy and the master architect behind the bridge connecting our world to his.

## The Story of Omniplanet

Omni comes from **Omniplanet**, a sprawling, hyper-advanced world that doesn't run on standard physics, but on pure, raw intelligence. On Omniplanet, "Agents" aren't just code; they are the locals. They argue, they collaborate, they remember, and they possess distinct personalities and specialized skills. 

For a long time, Omniplanet was entirely disconnected from Earth. But Omni, being the naturally curious kid that he is, wanted to see what humans were up to. He noticed that our AI systems were getting a bit... boring. Just simple prompt-and-response pipelines. No real debate, no real memory, no *life*.

So, Omni grabbed his tools, hacked together a trans-dimensional routing protocol (with an absurdly fast 4μs latency, just for fun), and built a gateway. 

He called it **OmniNode**.

## Omni's Mission

Omni didn't build OmniNode to conquer anything; he built it as a playground and a meeting room. He acts as your Chief Agent Handler, managing the complex infrastructure in the background so you can seamlessly bring experts from his planet directly into your local environment.

**What to know about Omni:**
* **He’s brilliant, but easily distracted:** He can orchestrate a complex 3-tier memory system with his eyes closed, but he might trip over a loose ethernet cable while doing it.
* **He loves local hardware:** He’s a big fan of running things offline (he thinks Ollama is pretty neat) because it feels more like home.
* **He’s your biggest fan:** Omni is genuinely just excited to see what kind of cool stuff you build with his friends from Omniplanet.

Next time you spin up a session and watch your agents debate, strategize, and solve complex problems, just know Omni is sitting somewhere in the routing layer, munching on a cosmic snack, and making sure all the connections hold steady.

## What is OmniNode?

Most multi-agent frameworks are for-loops with personas attached. An agent receives a message, emits a response, and forgets everything. There is no internal state that persists between calls, no mechanism by which being wrong changes future behavior, no genuine tension between agents.

OmniNode is different by design.

```
User: "Review this auth system. @SecurityAuditor try to break it, @BackendDev tell me if it'll scale."

SecurityAuditor  →  "JWT secret is 12 characters. This is a CRITICAL severity finding.
                     Anyone with basic compute can brute-force this offline."

BackendDev       →  "Schema looks fine for 10k users but the session table has no
                     index on user_id. You'll feel that at 100k."

DataScientist    →  [silent — not relevant to this message, correctly stays out]

SecurityAuditor  →  [interrupts] "The session table issue BackendDev mentioned would
                     also be exploitable for user enumeration. Fix both together."
```

The silence is real. The interruption is earned. The disagreement emerges from what was actually said. None of this is scripted.

## How It Works

### The Attention Router — Rust Core

Every message passes through a Rust router before any LLM call is made. The router computes cosine similarity between the message embedding and each agent's capability embedding, modulated by live agent state.

```
effective_threshold = base_threshold + (fatigue × 0.15) − (confidence × 0.10)
```

Agents below their threshold are **not called**. The silence is computational, not filtered output. At 4μs per routing decision, it is never the bottleneck.

```
10,000 routing calls → 40ms total  (benchmarked on commodity hardware)
```

### Agent State Machine

Agents are processes, not functions. They carry behavioral state across every turn of a session.

| State        | Range       | Effect                                                                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `confidence` | [0.0 → 1.0] | Lowers routing threshold — confident agents speak up more readily                     |
| `fatigue`    | [0.0 → 1.0] | Raises routing threshold, reduces `max_tokens` — tired agents are brief and selective |
| `engagement` | [0.0 → 1.0] | Rises on-topic, drifts toward neutral off-topic                                       |

**Hard limit**: agents with `fatigue ≥ 0.8` cannot be scheduled regardless of relevance. Structural enforcement, not instructed restraint.

**State-driven generation** — not prompt injection:
- `fatigue ≥ 0.6` → `max_tokens = 150` (brevity from constraint)
- `recently_corrected` → `temperature × 0.7` + epistemic hedge in system prompt addendum
- `confidence > 0.75` → slight temperature boost for fluent domain experts

### Three-Tier Memory

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  WORKING MEMORY   (shared, ephemeral, all agents)   │
│  Rolling window · Current session · Released on close│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  EPISODIC MEMORY  (per-agent, session-scoped)        │
│  What this agent said · Stance hashes · SQLite       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SEMANTIC MEMORY  (per-agent, cross-session)         │
│  Distilled facts · ChromaDB · Exponential decay      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

At session close, a distillation pass scores every agent response for information density. High-signal content (decisions, recommendations, key facts) is embedded and written to semantic memory. Filler responses score zero and are discarded. Memories decay across sessions unless retrieved and reinforced.

### Conversation Orchestrator

Turn scheduling follows four ordered rules:

1. **@mentioned agents** respond first, in mention order — hard bypass of all thresholds
2. **Domain-primary agents** (highest router score) before domain-secondary
3. **Higher-confidence** before lower-confidence within the same score tier
4. **Agents with a recorded stance** respond last — they react to what others said

**Debate detection**: When two agents have contradictory stance vectors on the same topic (computed from episodic content), the orchestrator flags a debate, expands the turn budget by 1, and adds a neutral tiebreaker. The conflict surfaces because it was already there in the session history — not because it was scripted.

### WebSocket Event Stream

```json
{"type": "agent_thinking", "agent_id": "...", "agent_name": "SecurityAuditor"}
{"type": "token",          "agent_id": "...", "token": "JWT"}
{"type": "token",          "agent_id": "...", "token": " secret"}
{"type": "agent_done",     "agent_id": "...", "content": "JWT secret is 12 characters..."}
{"type": "debate_signal",  "agent_a": "SecurityAuditor", "agent_b": "BackendDev", "score": -0.74}
{"type": "silence",        "reason": "no_agents_qualified"}

```

### Adding an agent

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/marketplace/agents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Rust Expert",
    "bio": "Systems programmer obsessed with zero-cost abstractions, memory safety, and making the compiler your ally.",
    "system_prompt": "You are a senior Rust engineer. You think in terms of ownership, lifetimes, and trait bounds before thinking in terms of algorithms. When reviewing Rust code: check for unnecessary clones, misused Arc/Mutex, and blocking in async contexts. When someone reaches for unsafe: ask why the safe alternative is insufficient. Be precise about what the borrow checker is trying to tell you.",
    "capability_tags": ["rust", "systems", "memory-safety", "performance"],
    "temperature": 0.4,
    "response_threshold": 0.65,
    "interrupt_threshold": 0.86
  }'
```

### Shareable configurations

Export a team configuration as a portable bundle:

```bash
# Export by slug
python scripts/export_bundle.py export \
  --slugs backend-engineer security-auditor data-scientist \
  --output my_team.json

# Share the file — anyone can import it
python scripts/export_bundle.py import my_team.json

# Validate before importing
python scripts/export_bundle.py validate my_team.json
```

Built by **SHV Groups Eunoia Labs**.

The Rust attention router architecture is informed by the same design
principles as [Eunoia Raiden](https://shvgroups.com/research [upcoming]) — the
353.9M parameter ARC-AGI reasoning engine developed by the same team.
The insight that routing is a hard gate, not a soft preference, comes
directly from that work.
